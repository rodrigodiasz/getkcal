# Getkcal

This project is designed to collect user data and calculate their basal metabolic rate (BMR) along with the number of calories they should consume to reach their fitness goals. Additionally, the project integrates an AI-powered API that provides a complete workout plan for the user, including five workouts throughout the week. The workout plan includes options for both strength training and cardio exercises.

## Features

- **User Data Collection**: Input your physical details and fitness goals.
- **BMR Calculation**: Calculates your basal metabolic rate to understand how many calories your body needs at rest.
- **Calorie Recommendation**: Provides a personalized calorie intake suggestion to help you achieve your fitness goals.
- **AI-Powered Workout Plan**: Receives a full 5-day workout plan generated by an AI, with both strength training (muscle building) and aerobic (cardio) options.

## How It Works

1. User inputs their personal information such as age, weight, height, and fitness goal.
2. The system calculates the userâ€™s BMR and suggests daily calorie intake.
3. The AI API generates a 5-day workout plan for the week, combining strength and cardio exercises.
4. The user receives both calorie recommendations and the workout plan to help achieve their fitness goals.

## Technologies Used

- **API Integration**: AI-powered API for workout generation
- **Fitness Calculations**: Basal metabolic rate and calorie needs calculation
